There are two ways to make one of these for your own event:

2. Click the fish in the top right hand corner & click Remix
4. Login to glitch (you can use github or other platforms to sign in)
5. Change the REPO_URL & TITLE variables in `routes/index.js` to match your project
5b (with a tiny bit of javascript you can take the customization much further!)
6. Click on Show at the top :) 

### Customisable and Robust
To publish online you need a publicly accessible server.

2. [install npm]() if you don't have it
3. Run `npm install`
4. Change the REPO_URL & TITLE variables in `routes/index.js` to match your project
5. Run `npm start`
6. It will now be accessible at localhost:3000
